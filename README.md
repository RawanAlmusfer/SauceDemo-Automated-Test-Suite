# SauceDemo Automated Test Suite (Playwright + POM)

This project contains an automated test suite for [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) built with **Playwright** using the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern.

It covers the **checkout flow** where a user logs in, selects 3 random items, adds them to the cart, and completes the purchase.
